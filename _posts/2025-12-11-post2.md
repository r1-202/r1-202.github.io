In this post I will be talking briefly about the tools I install throughout this journey, where to 
find them, and any special notes. I use Fedora Linux as the primary OS on my machine 
so the stuff here may not apply directly to users on Windows and other distros (e.g. debian).

# Computer Graphics Tools

At this point in my learning journey I already have enough practice with OpenGL and will be 
diving into Vulkan as a next step. Vulkan is a specification that 
defines APIs for interacting with the GPU and it really is the job 
of the GPU manufacturer (or the open-source community when applicable) 
to deliver a working implementation of the specification through the GPU device drivers. For example, I use 
an Nvidia GPU and Nvidia's proprietery drivers, and they do implement the Vulkan interface, so there
really is nothing to download at this point to run Vulkan apps! However there are some Vulkan related 
(dev) tools that can help when debuging and writing graphics applications that utilize the GPU, and those 
need to be installed.
